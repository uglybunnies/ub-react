The site features my web design portfolio, and will soon feature my art portfolio and other musings on web design and development.</p></header><section class="p0 ph2 pb2"><h2 class="s2 ruby">Origins</h2><p>Before Ugly Bunnies, there was SerpentVenom my previous site. I decided to let go of SerpentVenom a while ago and set out to build a new site. The name came about very surreptiously while I was teaching my class about how to search for available domains. I decided to look for uglybunnies.com and lo and behold, it was available.</p><h2 class="s2 ruby">Technical Information</h2><p>Ugly Bunnies was designed and built with standards in mind. The structure of the site is written in HTML5. Modern CSS is used to implement the layout and visual design. Funtionality is provided by unobtrusive JavaScript. Visitors using older versions of Internet Explorer may not be able to experience the site as intended.</p><h2 class="s2 ruby">About Michael</h2><p>As for me, I&#x27;m Michael Wong. I&#x27;m a Web Designer/Developer by trade but an artist at heart. I have designed or contributed to a wide variety of web projects including global sports events, e-commerce, software company corporate sites, government sites, non-profit sites, and personal sites that include blogs and art and design portfolios.</p><h2 class="s2 ruby">Art</h2><p>I studied Conceptual/Information Arts (CIA), a program within the Art Department at San Francisco State University (SFSU). CIA focuses on preparing artists and media experimenters to work at the cutting edge of technology. The study of contemporary digital production skills is accompanied by the analysis of the cultural context of technology, as well as experimentation with newly emerging technologies.</p><p>I use computers to create art both for the web and for print. Personal computers and the emergence of the internet have given artists like me an opportunity to create art that is not dependent upon grants, galleries or patrons. This means we have an autonomy that some working artists do not always enjoy. This autonomy makes communicating my message easier.</p><h3 class="s4 ruby">My Message</h3><p>I believe that art is a vehicle for raising awareness. As special interests and corporate money hold sway over our elected officials, most of us are only concerned about the next pop idol or TV survivor. What I want people to realize is that their apathy toward what goes on in our government is setting up a situation that will eventually be out of our control. I want to show people what they are missing and give them a reason to care.</p><h3 class="s4 ruby">Ad Art</h3><p>Sometimes print advertisements, especially billboards, will capture my attention in ways the advertisers did not intend. When this happens, my response is to take the intended message and tweak it to reflect my response to the original message. My Ad Art posters are the result of this exploration and manipulation of messages.</p><h3 class="s4 ruby">Photography</h3><p>I have been creating photographic imagery for over 17 years. I mainly work in color with occasional forays into Black and White. I started out with a 35mm Nikon FM2 but I have embraced digital photography because of the immediacy and affordability that the technology offers. Whether film or digital, all of my images are created in camera. Their compositions have not been digitally altered.</p><p>My photography reflects my desire to capture what I see. I begin with ideas like the view through a window, the unusual angles and scenes of urban life, the beauty of nature, or photographic experimentation. The results range from straightforward to the abstract.</p></section></div></main><footer class="site-footer pa2"><section><ul class="inline-list site-links m0 p0"><li class="m0 p0"><a href="/web-projects">Web Projects</a></li><li class="m0 p0"><a href="/about">About Ugly Bunnies</a></li></ul></section><p class="s8">Copyright Â© 2001-2018 Michael Wong.
